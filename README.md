# TAD: A Large-scale benchmark for traffic accidents detection from video surveillance.

We proposed a large-scale traffic accidents dataset from surveillance perspective.

At present, we only released the data of the network part mentioned in paper, and other data will be updated and uploaded gradually.

TrafficAccident-net (Part TAD) can be seen in Baidu Netdisk.
